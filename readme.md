<b>Camera Shop</b>: A website for a photo and video equipment store. This site, with its rich functionalities, enables customers to find and select products that cater to all tastes and needs, followed by an easy ordering process.

<b>Key functionalities include:</b>

• Sorting products by multiple parameters, intricate filtering by numerous parameters, and dynamic pagination that is linked to both sorting and filtering.

• Advanced handling of price ranges - automatic filling of the highest and lowest prices within a selected range, and automatic rounding to the nearest minimum or maximum price in the current range upon manual entry.

• A user-friendly product search system.

• Elegantly designed, constantly updating banners showcasing offers based on the products available in the catalog, created with Swiper.

• Comprehensive shopping cart features: displaying the number of items on the cart icon, maintaining the cart's state across user sessions, enabling the application of discount coupons with server-side validation, dynamically calculating discounts and total costs, and facilitating order information transmission to the server.

• To enhance user experience, the application incorporates 7 modal windows that activate in response to user actions like purchasing or removing a product. These modals prevent accidental clicks and adhere to uniform behavior rules."
